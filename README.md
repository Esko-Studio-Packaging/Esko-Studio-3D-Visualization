## What is Esko Studio?

**Esko Studio** is a comprehensive and professional software solution tailored for packaging designers, brand managers, and print professionals. It offers a robust set of tools for creating detailed 3D visualizations, structural designs, and photorealistic mockups of packaging projects. The software is widely recognized for its ability to bridge the gap between creative design and physical production, ensuring that ideas are accurately represented and easily validated before committing to print.

The integration with popular design software like Adobe Illustrator makes it a versatile choice for modern design workflows.

Beyond visualization, Esko Studio also includes tools for structural design, ensuring that packaging is not only visually appealing but also functional and manufacturable. This makes it an essential tool for reducing errors, saving time, and improving collaboration between designers, clients, and production teams.
